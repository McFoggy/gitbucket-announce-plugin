# gitbucket-announce-plugin

This plugin enhances [takezoe/gitbucket](https://github.com/takezoe/gitbucket) by providing an announce mechanism.

## Features

### Global Announce

This feature allows to notify gitbucket users. It is available to _admin_ users via  the `System Administration` menu of gitbucket.

The global announce, sends an email to all active users.

It is then possible, for example, to notify every user that an upgrade of the system is planned the next monday at midday.
